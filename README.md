TEST FOR FULL STACK DEVELOPER POSITION

We&#39;d like you to help us create a new Thingiverse web application. Thingiverse is a
website dedicated to the sharing of user-created digital design files, specially for 3d
printers. This website has an [open API](https://www.thingiverse.com/developers)
which exposes almost every content displayed inside the [official page](https://www.thingiverse.com/).
Your tasks are:
* Create a new front end page with the latest, newest, popular and featured things.
[Example](https://www.thingiverse.com/explore/popular/).
* Create a simple page that shows a thing details.
[Example](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3495390).
* Create a back end service to provide all data you need from thingiverse API.
Rules:
* Do not call Thingiverse API within front-end directly.
* Do not use any Thingiverse api abstraction package.
* Use the &#39;code&#39; response_type when the user is redirected to request Thingiverse
access. Exchange this code to get an access_token inside your back end service.
* Use React and Node.
Valuable:
* Build both front end and back end service in Typescript.
* Use GraphQL with Apollo stack and transform the Thingiverse API data you need to
GraphQL.
* Use any CSS-in-JS package or SCSS.
## Tips &amp; Tricks
Thingiverse API requires a basic user authentication. You will find a very nice guide on
[Thingiverse developers getting starter](https://www.thingiverse.com/developers/getting-started).

We&#39;re aware that you&#39;re working on this in your own time, so don&#39;t expect you to
spend a huge amount of time on it. It&#39;s more to give us an idea of how you interpret a
brief, approach a problem and structure your application!.
